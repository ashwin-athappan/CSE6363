## The Linear Regression Model

Implemented Methods:
- `fit(X, y)`: Fit the model using X, y.
- `predict(X)`: Predict the target variable for the given input.
- `score(X, y)`: Return the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction.
- `load(filename)`: Load the model from the file.
- `save(filename)`: Save the model to the file.
